# Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context

# Execution Context
```
Execution context is like a big box and it has two components in it.
The first component is also known as the memory component. This is the place where all the variables and functions are stored as the {key:value} pair.
This memory component is also known as the "Variable Environment".
```

```
The second component of this execution context is the code component. This is the place where code is executed one line at a time.
The code component is also known as the "Thread of Execution".
This thread of execution is just like a thread where whole code is excuted one line at a time.
```

# Javascript is Synchronus Single Threaded Language.

```
When we say single threaded that means javascript can execute one command at time.
```

```
And when we say synchronus single threded that means javascript can execute one command at a time in specific order. That means it can only go to the next line once the current line han been finished executing.
